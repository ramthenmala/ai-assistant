# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a modern AI chat assistant application with advanced UX features inspired by Msty.app. The application will be a cross-platform solution (Electron desktop + web) built with React and ShadCN UI components, focusing on powerful chat capabilities, multi-model comparisons, prompt management, and knowledge integration while maintaining offline-first functionality and a clean, intuitive interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to engage in natural conversations with AI assistants through an intuitive chat interface, so that I can get helpful responses in a familiar messaging format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with a scrolling message list and fixed input box at the bottom
2. WHEN a user types a message and sends it THEN the system SHALL display the message in a user bubble and stream the AI response in real-time
3. WHEN an AI response is being generated THEN the system SHALL show streaming text output with tokens appearing as they arrive
4. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL use alternating styling to distinguish user messages from AI responses
5. WHEN the chat history becomes long THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance through efficient rendering

### Requirement 2: Message Editing and Versioning

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit both my prompts and AI responses after they've been sent, so that I can refine conversations and explore different variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over any message THEN the system SHALL display an edit icon or provide access via context menu
2. WHEN a user clicks edit on a message THEN the system SHALL convert the message into an editable text area
3. WHEN a user edits a message THEN the system SHALL autosave changes and preserve chat history state
4. WHEN a message has been edited THEN the system SHALL display a small "edited" indicator for transparency
5. WHEN a user edits their prompt THEN the system SHALL offer to regenerate the AI response based on the changes
6. WHEN messages are edited THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for potential reversion

### Requirement 3: Conversation Branching (Multiverse Chats)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to fork conversations at any point to explore alternate questions or responses, so that I can investigate different paths without losing my original thread.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on any message THEN the system SHALL provide a "branch" option in the context menu
2. WHEN a user creates a branch THEN the system SHALL spawn a new conversation thread starting from that message
3. WHEN branches exist THEN the system SHALL indicate branch points with visual markers on the original messages
4. WHEN a user wants to navigate branches THEN the system SHALL provide a collapsible sidebar showing all branches in a hierarchical tree view
5. WHEN multiple branches exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to switch between branches by clicking nodes in the sidebar
6. WHEN branches become complex THEN the system SHALL offer an optional flowchart/minimap view showing the conversation structure as an interactive graph

### Requirement 4: Multi-Model Comparison (Split Chat)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compare responses from different AI models side by side, so that I can evaluate which model provides the best answer for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables split chat mode THEN the system SHALL divide the interface into multiple columns, each representing a different AI model
2. WHEN a user enters a prompt in split mode THEN the system SHALL send the same prompt to all selected models simultaneously
3. WHEN models respond THEN the system SHALL display each response in its respective column with clear model labeling
4. WHEN adding or removing model panels THEN the system SHALL provide easy controls to add new columns or remove existing ones
5. WHEN screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully adapt the layout (stacking vertically, using tabs, or horizontal scroll)
6. WHEN comparing responses THEN the system SHALL offer synchronized scrolling to keep responses aligned
7. WHEN switching between single and multi-model view THEN the system SHALL provide a clear toggle control

### Requirement 5: Prompt Library Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and reuse effective prompts and instructions, so that I can quickly access my best queries without retyping them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the prompt library THEN the system SHALL display a searchable panel with all saved prompts
2. WHEN creating a new prompt THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify title, description, tags, and prompt content
3. WHEN viewing saved prompts THEN the system SHALL display them in a filterable list with search functionality
4. WHEN a user selects a prompt THEN the system SHALL insert the prompt content into the chat input box
5. WHEN managing prompts THEN the system SHALL allow editing, deleting, and organizing prompts with tags
6. WHEN searching prompts THEN the system SHALL support filtering by tags and keyword search
7. WHEN prompts are created or modified THEN the system SHALL persist them locally across sessions

### Requirement 6: Knowledge Integration (RAG Support)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide reference documents to enhance AI responses with my own knowledge base, so that I can get more accurate and contextual answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add knowledge sources THEN the system SHALL provide options to upload files or add folders
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL index them and display indexing progress with status indicators
3. WHEN sources are indexed THEN the system SHALL allow users to organize them into knowledge stacks or collections
4. WHEN starting a chat THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which knowledge sources are active for that conversation
5. WHEN knowledge sources are active THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the chat interface with a clear status display
6. WHEN managing sources THEN the system SHALL show the status of each source (indexed, active, error) with appropriate visual feedback
7. WHEN sources fail to index THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry or removal

### Requirement 7: Persistent Chat History and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my conversations to be saved and organized, so that I can easily find and continue previous discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load and display all previous chat sessions
2. WHEN viewing chat history THEN the system SHALL provide a sidebar listing all past conversations with titles
3. WHEN organizing chats THEN the system SHALL allow users to group conversations into folders or workspaces
4. WHEN searching for chats THEN the system SHALL provide a search function to find conversations by keyword
5. WHEN chat sessions are created or modified THEN the system SHALL automatically save them to persistent storage

5. WHEN changing appearance THEN the system SHALL provide theme options (dark/light/auto) that apply immediately
6. WHEN viewing shortcuts THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for power users
7. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL save changes automatically and apply them immediately where possible

### Requirement 9: Offline-First Performance and Reliability
